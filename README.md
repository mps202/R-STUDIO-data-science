A-Introduction: 

This report aims to conduct a thorough analysis of cardiovascular health by exploring various factors that may contribute to the risk of heart attacks. The investigation is motivated by the critical importance of understanding and mitigating heart attack risks, given the significant impact cardiovascular diseases have on global health.


A-1 Background:

Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding the factors associated with heart attack risk is crucial for preventive healthcare strategies and improving overall heart health. The dataset under examination was downloaded from Kaggle comprises diverse variables related to age, gender, heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, and cardiac biomarkers.
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bharath011/heart-disease-classification-dataset).
The motivation for examining this dataset lies in its potential to uncover patterns and associations between these variables and the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack. Such insights can inform targeted interventions, personalized healthcare plans, and public health initiatives to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of this dataset, we aim to enhance preventative measures and promote heart health at both individual and population levels.
